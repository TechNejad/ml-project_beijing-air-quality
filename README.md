# Beijing Air Quality – A Machine Learning Project

This repository documents a machine learning project analyzing air pollution in Beijing (2010–2014). Developed jointly as part of the 'Topics on Machine Learning and its Applications' and 'Applied Programming for Data Science' courses as part of the Master's of Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Societies (AISS).

## Project Overview

This project explores temporal and meteorological patterns in Beijing’s air quality using real-world PM2.5 sensor data. Following the **CRISP-DM methodology**, the notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling (in progress). The project is designed to reflect a thoughtful, beginner-level understanding of python for data science and ML techniques.
